---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure

1. **Install and initialize OpenVAS**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y gvm
   sudo gvm-setup
   sudo gvm-start

Access OpenVAS Web UI at:
üëâ [https://localhost:9392](https://localhost:9392)
(Login using the admin credentials created during setup.)

2. **Create a Target**

   * Target IP: `[REDACTED_IP]`
   * Port Range: Default (1‚Äì65535)
   * Alive Test: Consider alive

3. **Create and Run a Task**

   * Scan Config: *Full and Fast*
   * Target: `[REDACTED_IP]`
   * Task Name: *Metasploitable Scan*
   * Start Scan and wait for completion.

4. **Generate and Export Report**

   * Format: PDF / HTML / XML
   * Exported Report Name: `OpenVAS_Scan_[REDACTED_IP].pdf`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Outdated OS (EOL)

* Upgrade to a supported OS version (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
* Apply all security updates and patches regularly.
* Decommission legacy systems if not upgradable.

### 2. Weak / Default Credentials

* Enforce strong password policies for all accounts.
* Change default credentials immediately.
* Use SSH keys instead of password authentication.
* Restrict database logins to trusted hosts.

### 3. Web Application Vulnerabilities (TWiki, Tiki Wiki)

* Upgrade to patched versions.
* Implement input validation and output encoding.
* Deploy a Web Application Firewall (e.g., ModSecurity).
* Remove unnecessary plugins or outdated CMS modules.

### 4. DistCC Remote Code Execution

* Restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
* Disable DistCC if not in use.
* Apply vendor patches.

### 5. Apache Range Header DoS

* Update Apache to version 2.2.20+ or 2.4.x.
* Enable `mod_reqtimeout` to limit request header sizes.
* Monitor web logs for abuse attempts.

### 6. phpinfo() File Disclosure

* Delete or restrict access to phpinfo files.
* Disable `display_errors` in `php.ini`.
* Use staging environments for configuration testing.

### 7. Expired SSL/TLS Certificates

* Renew SSL certificates and configure auto-renewal with Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
* Enforce TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 only.
* Disable weak ciphers and protocols.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The OpenVAS vulnerability scan effectively identified multiple high-risk misconfigurations and outdated services on the target system.
Applying the above mitigation steps will significantly reduce the system‚Äôs attack surface and strengthen overall network security posture.
